# dotfiles

## Repository Contents
This repo contains my customized dotfiles to set up a personal enviroment quickly and consistently for Linux machines. <br>
It contains the following folders:
- `/vim-config/`: Vim settings, installs Vundle, sets up color schemes, installs plugins.
- `/homefiles/`: Bash aliases, bash customization files, with scripts to link them into the home directory.
- `/sys-installs/`: This contains a script for installing Ansible on the Ubuntu system.

## Setup & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
``` git clone https://github.com/tbyoung244/dotfiles ```
``` cd dotfiles ```

2. Navigate to which folder you want:
- `vim-config` - For VIM Setup
- `homefiles` - For Bash Aliases
- `sys-installs` - For Ansible install script

3. For additional info on each folder, read the `README.md` in the respective folder for information.

## Improvements Made
I made improvements to Task 1 - vim & Vundle.
- I fixed where I initally missed adding the `.vimrc` to the `/vim-config/` folder. Added it correctly to folder.
- Also added a README.md to explain how to install the vim setup and a usage guide.
- Also highlighted other issues in the issue section of the dotfiles but I did not fix them.
