# VIM Config Setup

This folder contains the custom Vim configuration using Vundle.

## Installation Guide

Get `installVim.sh` via ``` wget https://github.com/tbyoung244/dotfiles/blob/main/vim-config/installVim.sh ```

Run the `installVim.sh` script to:
- Copy `.vimrc` to home directory.
- Installs Vundle if it is not already installed.
- Installs Vim plugins automatically
